the moon was doing absolutely nothing fr but the sky kept acting like it was the main character, the wind was beefing with the trees for no reason, and somewhere a random pigeon probably plotting world domination. meanwhile humans out here stressing about wi-fi signals and why chargers disappear like socks in a washing machine. life be moving weird, like one minute you vibing and the next minute you questioning why bread gets moldy but chips stay fresh for 3 years. time ain’t real, money ain’t real, school definitely ain’t real, and yet here we are pretending like we got the patch notes for reality. everything’s goofy, everything’s chaotic, but lowkey kinda fire at the same time. this text means absolutely nothing but it’s long enough to make you look like you did something important.
